//javascript engine is responsible for the execution our code it not execute directly. 
//To execute code engine create a environment is called as execution context is nothing but an environment where code stored and execute.
//Execution context created in two scenarios: 
               //1. Global execution context: Once for whole javascrip code -window object- this keyword is reference.
               //2. Functional execution context: whenever function is called in a program new function execution context will create.- variables and arguments.
//Whenever execution context created it has two components               
// 1.Memory component: Variables, values-is also called as variable environment 
// 2.Code component: code- is also called as thread of execution.
// In memory component variable and functions values can be stored in a  key value format.
//Execution context has two phases: creation, execution
//code execution- 1. call stack 2.scope chain-we can access variables wherever we want use.
//function invocation square()
//Javascript syncronus single threaded lunguage- the code will execute in format it cannot execute secound line untill first.
// Global space- anything which is not inside the function.
